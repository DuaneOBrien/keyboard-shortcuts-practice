Techtonica is a nonprofit that provides free tech training with stipends and job placement to women and non-binary adults with low incomes. 

We discovered that our participants need an app similar to typing practice websites out there, but for Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts. 

This project should train and test users to use the quicker keyboard shortcuts ([starting with those outlined here](https://github.com/Techtonica/keyboard-shortcuts-practice/issues/3)) instead of a mouse and the GUI.
