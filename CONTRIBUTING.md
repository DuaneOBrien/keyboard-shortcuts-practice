### Volunteering:

If you would like to contribute to the curriculum, please [sign up here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeW0mo-Dpsig70374UEPvzexpas-31Ost_HsFwm0kjNOxtbtg/viewform?c=0&w=1), then choose an issue in the [to-do list.](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/projects/2)

**Get started:**
- Click a "to-do" issue link and add yourself as the assignee, and pull it into the "in progress" column. (You'll need a github account to comment. If you know someone connected to Techtonica, they may be able to add you to our slack channel.)
- In the issue, you should find a link for a lesson outline and for corresponding slides. 
- If it is in the "to-do" column, that means it is available. You are welcome to message questions to past assignees that may still show on the issue.
    - To create an outline, fork the repo or commit directly onto the master branch.  
    - To edit a slideshow, you'll need to request edit permission by clicking View Only > Request Edit Access. If you are logged into an account ending in @gmail.com, you can simply make a copy, edit, and transfer ownership to techtonicaorg@gmail.com when you finish. Either way, save on top of the sample template used in the slide, and cut any slides you find unnecessary.
    - To make a video, one effective solution has been to record your screen as you explain the lesson slides to the apprentices. An alternative can be a video found online that covers all the objectives of the lesson in a way suited to beginners.
    - Here is an example of a great lesson trio: [MongoDB Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BvO6PrSpulHVSDNOkMaDZM-V7McmheLgm0Lg2PFae7k/edit#slide=id.p), [MongoDB Lesson Outline](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/databases/mongo-db.md), [MongoDB Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1022MSkPjfRyGAUQa2I-pQltpUn4Q1NJc/view).

**While working:**
- Comment in the issue if you have a question, and add the "question" tag to help get our attention.
- People are welcome to team up on an issue.  If you see someone is already assigned but you want to help, leave the other assignee a message on the issue about collaborating.
- Please note the due date! Any amount of help is appreciated, but if the deadline comes and you won't be able to complete it, please leave a comment about your progress and unassign yourself from the issue so someone else can pick it up. If you forked the repo, go ahead and make a pull request with what you have, and transfer ownership of a copied slideshow to techtonicaorg@gmail.com.

**Completed curriculum:**
- Place a "completed" label on the issue once you've completed it, and leave comments about your work if you like. Grazie Mille!!
